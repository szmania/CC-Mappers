# Custom Example Mod

This directory serves as a template for creating a custom "playthrough" for the Crusader Conflicts application. Below is an explanation of each file and its purpose.

## File Descriptions

-   **`Cultures/OfficialCC_Custom_Default_Cultures.xml`**: This file defines the cultures for your custom playthrough. You can map specific cultures to different unit rosters and cultural attributes.

-   **`Factions/OfficialCC_Custom_Default_Factions.xml`**: This file is used to define the factions. It specifies the units available to each faction, including their generals, knights, and men-at-arms.

-   **`Terrains/OfficialCC_Custom_Default_Terrains.xml`**: This file maps different terrain types to modifiers that can affect battles or unit performance.

-   **`TimePeriod.xml`**: This file sets the start and end dates for your custom playthrough scenario.

-   **`Titles/` (Optional)**: The XML files within this directory (`Counties.xml`, `Duchies.xml`, `Kingdoms.xml`) allow you to assign specific unit rosters to landed titles (e.g., a specific duchy or kingdom), overriding the default culture-based unit assignments.

-   **`background.png`**: This is the background image that will be displayed in the Crusader Conflicts application when your custom playthrough is selected.

-   **`tag.txt`**: This file contains a unique tag or identifier for your custom playthrough.

## XML Validation

When this playthrough is enabled in the Crusader Conflicts application, all XML files will be automatically validated against their respective schemas to ensure they are correctly formatted and free of errors.
